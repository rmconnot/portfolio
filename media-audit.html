						Problem
					</h3>
					<p class="case-study-paragraph">
						University of Michigan departments need to perform audits of their
						websites' media libraries every year. Previously, these audits were
						performed manually, requiring > 2,500 hours of data entry per year.
					</p>
					<h3 class="case-study-subheading">Actions</h3>
					<p class="case-study-paragraph">
						I proposed and built a desktop app which takes a base URL, performs
						a full audit of the website's media library, and formats that data
						into a CSV file placed on the user's desktop.
					</p>
					<h3 class="case-study-subheading">Results</h3>
					<p class="case-study-paragraph">
						The desktop app is used by all departments throughout the College of
						Engineering for both their yearly audits and site migration needs.

				<h2 class="case-study-heading">Background</h2>
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					All University of Michigan College of Engineering affiliated websites
					are built and maintained with WordPress. WordPress sites have a
					<i>media library</i> feature that allows users to upload media to be
					used on their website. Many University of Michigan websites have more
					than 5,000 items in their respective media libraries.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					In order to ensure that each piece of uploaded media conforms to
					certain standards (e.g. SEO-friendly filename, web-optimized size, alt
					text, etc.), site owners throughout the College are required to
					perform an audit of their media libraries each year. Additonally,
					events such as site migrations may also necessitate an audit. The
					audit involves collecting the following information about each item in
					the media library:
				</p>
				<ul class="case-study-bullets">
					<li>ID</li>
					<li>Filename</li>
					<li>Image dimensions</li>
					<li>File size</li>
					<li>Alt text</li>
					<li>Caption</li>
					<li>Duplicate?</li>
					<li>Uploaded by:</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					In the past, site owners (or the student interns they hired for this
					task) would manually go through the media library in the website's
					WordPress admin interface and copy+paste information about each item
					into a spreadsheet. This was a tedious, time-consuming task that was
					ultimately inefficient and error-prone. When I was briefly assigned to
					assist with this process, I disliked it so much that I set aside time
					to automate it.
				</p>
				<h2 class="case-study-heading">Functionality</h2>
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					Initially, I simply created a Python script that would make calls to a
					website's
					<a
						class="body-link"
						href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/"
						target="blank"
						>WordPress REST API</a
					>
					endpoint, iterating through its media library and writing relevant
					information (listed above) about each item to a CSV file. The user can
					then review the CSV file to determine which media items need to be
					fixed.
				</p>
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					I ran this script for several College of Engineering websites, simply
					adjusting the target URL each time; however, soon many of the College
					departments wanted to use the tool as well. The department site admins
					were not tech-literate enough to modify a script or run a Python file
					from the command line, so I couldn't just share the script with them.
					Since the script was written in Python, I decided to use
					<a
						class="body-link"
						href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html"
						target="blank"
						>Tkinter
					</a>
					to create a simple user interface where a user can provide a target
					URL and receive feedback about the progress of the script.
				</p>

						<img src="./images/media-audit-screenshot--completed.png" />
						<div class="screenshot-subtitle">Media Audit UI (finished)</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br />
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					Adding the Tkinter interface required using multithreading in order to
					handle user input and run the auditing script at the same time. This
					was my first experience using multithreading and it was initially
					difficult to implement properly so that the threads could communicate
					with eachother. However, I was able to find similar examples to learn
					from.
				</p>

				<h2 class="case-study-heading">Next Steps</h2>
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					Some of the top priorities moving forward include:
				</p>
				<ul class="case-study-bullets">
					<li>
						Improved UI - tkinter UIs are notoriously unappealing; however, the
						program's current tkinter window could benefit from an improved
						layout as well as aesthetic modifications.
					</li>
					<li>
						Modify the program to simply update a master database of media
						items, instead of creating a fresh CSV file each time it is run.
					</li>
					<li>
						Potentially deploy and host the program online so that a dekstop app
						isn't needed
					</li>
