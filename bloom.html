						Problem
					</h3>
					<p class="case-study-paragraph">
						Gardeners, especially beginners, can be easily overwhelmed by the
						responsibilities involved with starting and maintaining a garden.
						Specifically, knowing which plants are suited to growing in their
						area, and then monitoring the progress of those plants (after
						they've been planted), can be considerable obstacles for gardeners.
					</p>
					<h3 class="case-study-subheading">Actions</h3>
					<p class="case-study-paragraph">
						I designed and developed a simple mobile app that enables users to
						discover which plants are suitable to their location (based on
						zipcode), add them to their virtual garden, then monitor the plants'
						progress by adding notes and photos.
					</p>
					<h3 class="case-study-subheading">Results</h3>
					<p class="case-study-paragraph">
						An MVP of the app has been built, and is currently undergoing
						iterative impovements before being deployed.

				<h2 class="case-study-heading">Background</h2>

				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					Many members of my family are avid gardeners. Since they are fairly
					geographically dispersed, they are limited in the relevant gardening
					knowledge they can share with eachother. Plants that grow well in one
					region may not grow well (or at all) in another. Additionally, many of
					them take notes about their gardens on paper and experience difficulty
					organizing and referencing these notes.
				</p>

				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) assigns hardiness
					zones to regions of the United States so that farmers (and gardeners)
					can better understand how well different plants will grow in a
					specific region. It's relatively easy to determine which hardiness
					zone you live in; however, it's difficult to determine which plants
					are suitable to your hardiness zone. There is no centralized database
					of all the plants and their hardiness zones.
				</p>

				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					For the final project of my
					<i>SI 669 - Developing Mobile Experiences</i> course, I designed and
					built a mobile app that provides a list of plants that are suitable to
					the user's hardiness zone. Additionally, users can create a virtual
					representation of their garden(s) and add their plants to it. Finally,
					they can add notes and images to their gardens' plants to help monitor
					their progress and even help plan for the next year.
				</p>

				<h2 class="case-study-heading">Backend</h2>
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					For the purposes of this app, I essentially needed to create a series
					of nested one-to-many relationships (users -> gardens -> plants ->
					notes). This led to me explore NoSQL databases as possible backend
					solutions. Ultimately, I found
					<span class="embolden">Google Firebase</span> and decided that its
					<a
						class="body-link"
						href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/"
						target="blank"
						>Firestore Database</a
					>
					service fit the needs of this project perfectly.
				</p>

				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					Firestore is a NoSQL database composed of <i>collections</i> and
					<i>documents</i>. The collections are essentially arrays, while the
					documents act as objects. For this project, I used three primary
					collections: Users, Plants, and Zipcodes. However, the Users
					collection contains a number of nested collections and documents. The
					Plants and Zipcodes collections only contain documents.

				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					Firebase provides a number of backend features that facilitate basic
					CRUD functionality, as well as more advanced features such as
					subscriptions. Although this setup made development simple and easy,
					it also created some headache when trying to implement custom backend
					functionality (e.g. duplicate username prevention). Much of this
					functionality had to be moved to the frontend.
				</p>

				<h2 class="case-study-heading">Frontend</h2>
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					The app's frontend was built in React Native and used the Expo
					framework to tap into native features, such as the camera. In order to
					communicate with the backend, it uses the
					<a
						class="body-link"
						href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase"
						target="blank"
						>Firebase SDK</a
					>, which provides a number of built-in CRUD functions for both the
					Firestore database and the Firebase Storage service (which is used to
					store user photos).
				</p>

				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					To start, I created a rough series of
					<a
						class="body-link"
						href="https://www.figma.com/file/ENl24E9HDrDFfhauTMh5G4/SI-699-Final-Project?node-id=0%3A1"
						target="blank"
						>low-fidelity wireframes</a
					>
					to demonstrate the app's user flow.

				</div>
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					I then created a basic React Native app and built out the necessary
					functionality. For the data model, I used the simpleton pattern to
					reduce complexity. Next, I styled the the screens and their elements.
					The functionality of the app was relatively simple to develop;
					however, this was my first experience using React Native's styling
					functionality. Using flex properly within React Native can be
					frustrating and took awhile to fully understand.

				<h2 class="case-study-heading">Next Steps</h2>

				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					Some of the top priorities moving forward include:
				</p>
				<ul class="case-study-bullets">
					<li>Improve the styling on the app's frontend</li>
					<li>Improve the UX of the login process</li>
					<li>Add more plants to the database</li>
					<li>Add stock images for all of the plants</li>
					<li>
						Provide an option to automatically determine the user's hardiness
						zone based on their phone's GPS location
					</li>
					<li>
						Enable the user to set up reminders through the app (e.g. water the
						tomatoes)
					</li>
					<li>Provide more advanced filtering/sorting options for plants</li>
