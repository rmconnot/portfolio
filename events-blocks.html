						Problem
					</h3>
					<p class="case-study-paragraph">
						Michigan Engineering needed a way to inform students about upcoming
						College events on their websites.
					</p>
					<h3 class="case-study-subheading">Actions</h3>
					<p class="case-study-paragraph">
						I worked with a cross-functional team to research, design, and
						develop two modular, customizable blocks. One maintains an
						up-to-date feed of upcoming events (which can be filtered based on
						various criteria), and a second displays a card for an individual
						event.
					</p>
					<h3 class="case-study-subheading">Results</h3>
					<p class="case-study-paragraph">
						While the development of the overall design system is still ongoing,
						the events blocks are complete and are currently being used on
						Michigan Engineering websites.
					</p>

			<div class="case-study-text">
				<h2 class="case-study-heading">Background</h2>

				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					With the introdcution of the
					<a
						class="body-link"
						href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/"
						target="blank"
						>Gutenberg Editor</a
					>
					for WordPress, Michigan Engineering made the decision to create a new
					design system for the College of Engineering. This design system, and
					the functional components it contains, affects all of the College's
					websites (>100 individual sites). Nearly all of these websites need a
					way to pull information about upcoming College events and display them
					to users.
				</p>

				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					The purpose of Gutenberg is to provide users with an intuitive,
					modular, WYSIWYG-like experience for building and editing pages. This
					necessitates the use of modular components (blocks) that users can add
					to a page, edit, and display on the frontend. Gutenberg blocks are
					primarily built using React.js; however, dynamic blocks (where the
					block changes in reaction to certain conditions) also need to be
					developed in PHP.
				</p>
				<h2 class="case-study-heading">Events Feed Block</h2>
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					The Events Feed Block is a dynamic block that takes user input and
					creates a visual feed of College events pulled from
					<a class="body-link" href="https://events.umich.edu/" target="blank"
						>Happening@Michigan</a
					>. The displayed events are filtered based on the provided input.
				</p>

				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					Events data is cached by utilizing
					<a
						class="body-link"
						href="https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/handbook/transients/"
						target="blank"
						>WordPress Transients</a
					>. This prevents a fresh API call from being made every time a user
					opens a page with an Events Feed Block present. Data received from a
					previous API call is stored for 1 hour, after which a new API call is
					made to retrieve up-to-date events data.

				<br /><br />
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					Users are able to specify a number of options when creating a new
					events feed block. These options primarily filter the events, but they
					can also change how the events are displayed.
				</p>

				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					All college units have a sponsor ID which can be used to filter the
					upcoming events that are displayed. Users can also provide additional
					filtering criteria such as the type of events and the tags associated
					with them.
				</p>

				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					The block's appearance can also be changed to meets the needs of the
					users. These options were the result of user research conducted
					several months in advance.

				<h2 class="case-study-heading">Single Event Block</h2>
				<p class="case-study-paragraph">
					The Single Event Block takes user input in the editing interface,
					retrieves data about a specified event from
					<a class="body-link" href="https://events.umich.edu/" target="blank"
						>Happening@Michigan</a
					>, and displays an event "card" on the frontend.
