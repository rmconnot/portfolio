            <h2 class="case-study-header">Background</h2>
            
            <p class="case-study-paragraph">Michigan Engineering's Blue Sky Initiative is a $10 million funding program encouraging high-risk, high-reward research. The new funding model is designed to give research teams a chance to try big, daring ideas, show results and build enough momentum to secure investment from external partners.

                <br><br>

                Selected research teams receive funding (up to $2.5 million over 3 years) and are required to progress through a series of defined milestones to consistently assess the development of their concepts. The first four Blue Sky Initiative teams were selected in summer 2018.</p>

            <h2 class="case-study-header">Discovery</h2>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph">In order to increase awareness of the important research these teams are pursuing, our team at the Michigan Engineering Office of Communications & Marketing decided that the teams needed to have a greater web presence. This would allow the research teams to:
            </p>
                <br>
                <ul class="case-study-bullets">
                <li>Share important updates and milestones from their research</li>
                <li>Gain greater attention from news media - specifically outlets focused on technology and/or higher education</li>
                <li>Point potential investors to a well-designed resource that conveys the significance of their research.</li></ul>
                <br><br>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph">Next, we brainstormed different ways that we could establish a web presence for the teams. Ultimately, we narrowed our options down to <span class = 'embolden'>two ideas:</span></p>

                <p class="case-study-paragraph" id = 'ultimately'>
                Ultimately, we decided on <span class = 'embolden'>option 2</span> for a few reasons:
                </p>
                <ul class="case-study-bullets">
                <li>The Blue Sky Initiative already has a place on the College of Engineering website.</li>
                <li>Research teams would have total ownership over their site and could modify content as they see fit, providing more incentive to maintain and update it</li>
                <li>The research projects are unique and interesting enough to warrant individual sites. The most exciting thing about them isn’t that they’re all part of the Blue Sky Initiative - it's the cutting edge research they're pursuing.</li>
                </ul></p>
                
            <h2 class="case-study-header">Research</h2>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph">All four of the Blue Sky research teams currently have personal lab websites. In order to ensure that the new sites would contain the necessary content and be familiar enough for the researchers to maintain, I analyzed their current lab websites and made a list of the features and functionality present on each.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p class="case-study-paragraph" id = 'small-paragraph-spacing'>After evaluating the lab websites, I compared and contrasted the content and features present on each site. Overall, despite some minor differences, they were all very similar; they all contained:
                <ul class="case-study-bullets" id = 'small-spacing'>
                <li>A <span class="embolden">Home</span> page with a short introduction to the lab and their research</li>
                <li>A <span class="embolden">People</span> page with a list of the researchers currently working in the lab</li>
                <li>A <span class="embolden">Research</span> page displaying the research currently being conducted at the lab</li>
                <li>A <span class="embolden">Teaching</span> page with a list of courses currently being taught by the lab’s principal investigator</li>
                <li>A <span class="embolden">Publications</span> page with a list of links to published research produced by the lab</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p class="case-study-paragraph">From a design perspective, the lab websites were severely lacking. Some of them used styling reminiscent of the late 1990s (cursor effects, unnecessary sidebars,  etc.) while others were disorganized and had poor information architecture. The main takeaway from this evaluation was that the lab websites were not effective in conveying the world-changing importance of the research these labs are pursuing.</p>

            <br>

            <p class="case-study-paragraph" id = 'small-paragraph-spacing'>After meeting with the leader of the web team and discussing the findings from my research, we decided that the lab websites were similar enough that we could create a template for all three Blue Sky researcher websites. We also came up with a list of content and features that the template must include, namely:
                <ul class="case-study-bullets" id = 'small-paragraph-spacing'>
                    <li>Information describing what the respective research project is (in plain english)</li>
                    <li>An area where researchers can update their research milestones</li>
                    <li>A page displaying the research team</li>
                    <li>Information about the Blue Sky Initiative as well as forward paths to reference materials on the Michigan Engineering website</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="case-study-paragraph">We also evaluated different CMSs we could use for the websites. Although nearly all of the Michigan Engineering websites use WordPress, we decided that the WordPress backend would present too much friction for researchers to adopt and update regularly. Therefore, we settled on Google Sites as a suitable platform to build the websites due to its simple, user-friendly interface.</p>

            <h2 class="case-study-header">Information Architecture & Content Strategy</h2>

            <p class="case-study-paragraph" id = 'small-paragraph-spacing'>After finalizing the design requirements for the websites, I began gathering all of the potential content that would be used. This content included:
                <ul class="case-study-bullets" id = 'small-paragraph-spacing'>    
                <li>Photography from the university’s flickr</li>
                <li>Copy that was specific to the research projects, from press releases and news articles</li>
                <li>Lists of research team members</li>
                <li>Blue Sky specific images, quotes, and copy</li>
                </ul></p>

            <h3 class="case-study-subheading">Sitemap</h3>

            <p class="case-study-paragraph">After gathering all of the available content for the websites, I had a better understanding of how they should be laid out. I then started developing potential sitemaps for the template using Slickplan. First, I laid out all of the content pieces I had finalized for use on the website. Next, I organized those content pieces in several different formats that reflected different site structures. I presented these sitemaps to the web team leader and we discussed their pros and cons. We ultimately decided on a final sitemap:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="blue-sky-sitemap-container">
            <img src="Blue_Sky_sitemap.png" id="blue-sky-sitemap">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph">
                <span class="embolden">Staying ahead of biothreats:</span> The homepage of the website includes several important pieces of content:
                <ul class="case-study-bullets">
                <li>Hero image with introduction to research and forward path to the research page</li>
                <li>A series of small promo boxes for the PI, Research Updates, and Press</li>
                <li>A promo for the Blue Sky Initiative that includes a forward path to the Blue Sky Initiative page</li>
                </ul></p>
                <br>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph">
                <span class="embolden">Research:</span> Provides a more detailed description of the research as well as a forward path to the research team page.
                <br><br>
                <span class="embolden">Research Team:</span> Displays the entire research team and includes researchers’ names, portraits, titles, and forward paths to their profile pages on the university’s website.
                <br><br>
                <span class="embolden">Lab Notebook:</span> Essentially a blog page for extended research updates
                <br><br>
                <span class="embolden">Blue Sky Initiative:</span> Promotes the Blue Sky Initiative and includes forward paths to blue sky information on the university website. The page will eventually include a forward path to the Blue Sky podcast.
                <br><br>
                <span class="embolden">Press:</span> Essentially a press kit containing important quotes, links to press releases, and media contacts.
                <br><br>
                <span class="embolden">Digital Assets:</span> A collection of multimedia materials that researchers would like the press to have access to. These could be slideshow presentations, videos, or publications related to the research.

            </p>
            <br>
        <h3 class="case-study-subheading">Content Strategy</h3>

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">With the sitemap finalized, I moved on to developing the content strategy for the websites. This process involved determining:
            <ul class="case-study-bullets" id = 'small-paragraph-spacing'>
            <li>Which pieces of available content would be utilized</li>
            <li>What new content needed to be created</li>
            <li>Where each piece of content would live on the websites</li>
            </ul>
            
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            Throughout the content strategy process, I considered how each decision would impact the research teams that would need to update and maintain the websites. I also attempted to balance promotion of the Blue Sky Initiative with information about the research projects.
            
            <br><br>

            Thankfully, the Communications & Marketing Office has many talented photographers, illustrators, and writers that provided a wealth of content for me to choose from. I didn’t need to request any additional photography or illustrations and I only needed a minimal amount of new copy. I worked with two of our writers to determine what the new copy needed to accomplish for the website.</p>
        </p>    
        
        <h2 class="case-study-header">Design</h2>

        <p class="case-study-paragraph" id = 'small-paragraph-spacing'>Finally, with the sitemap and content strategy complete, I began designing and building the actual template. From the beginning, I decided to build out one research team’s site first, in order to see how well everything fit together with real content in place.

            <br><br>

            Due to the ease of building and modifying websites in Google Sites, a minimal amount of wireframes needed to be produced. I simply sketched (by hand) rough wireframes indicating how the page should be laid out, then immediately applied those designs to the template. Then  I modified my sketches based on how how well they translated to the Google Sites formatting, making notes about their strengths and weaknesses. 
            
            <br><br>

            Ultimately, through this iterative design process, I developed a minimum viable product that I presented to the executive director of the Michigan Engineering Office of Communications and Marketing.</p>

        <h3 class="case-study-subheading">Review</h3>

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">With the “first draft” of the website complete, I presented it to several senior members of the office, including the executive director. This was the first design project I had ever worked on and I was unsure of what feedback to expect. I walked them through my entire process, starting with the research I conducted at the beginning of the project. As I presented, they asked  many “why?” questions. I explained the reasoning behind the design decisions I made and cited my research when necessary. This experience taught me to anticipate stakeholders’ questions and concerns, and to preemptively explain my reasoning for important decisions.

            <br><br>

            At the end of the review, I received great feedback and only needed to make some minor changes to content formatting. One of the memorable comments I received was, “I can’t believe this was made using Google Sites”.</p>

        <h2 class="case-study-header">Delivery</h2>

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">With the office leadership’s stamp of approval, I implemented the changes they suggested and moved on to creating two supplementary documents to help the research teams understand how their websites work and ensure that they’re following best practices when making updates.

            <br><br>

            The first document I created was a website overview that explained all of the website’s features as well as how to update each of them.
            
            <br><br>

            The second document I created was a best practices toolkit that provides guidance for making content on the websites accessible, SEO friendly, and easy for a public audience to digest.
            </p>

        <h2 class='case-study-header'>The End Result</h2>
        <p class='case-study-paragraph'>The finished websites which utilize the template our office created can be found by using the following links:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class='case-study-links'>

        <h2 class="case-study-header">The "should have, could have, would haves”</h2>

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">Researching, designing, and building these websites was a great introduction to web design and development. However, looking back, there are a number of actions that I wish we could have taken but were ultimately unable to. 
            <br><br>
            Most importantly, I wish we could have included the research teams in the decision-making process more. Although I conducted research on their current lab websites to get a grasp of the features that would be familiar to them, early feedback from the research teams themselves would have been invaluable.</p>
