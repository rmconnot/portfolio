            <p class='case-study-paragraph'>As a companion resource to his recently published book <span id='rich-brew-link'><a href='https://nyupress.org/9781479827893/a-rich-brew/'>A Rich Brew: How Cafés Created Modern Jewish 
                Culture (NYU Press)</a></span>, Professor Shachar Pinsker set out to create a website that would allow people to interact with the book’s 
                information in novel ways. He worked with a team of students to accomplish this. They designed and built a website that possessed 
                interesting features but lacked polish. After it was completed, Prof. Pinsker received feedback from NYU Press pointing out issues 
                with the website’s UX. I was then brought on to the team as a UX Designer to help identify and remedy the website’s shortcomings.
            </p>

            <h2 class='case-study-header'>Design</h2>
            <p class='case-study-paragraph'>After joining the team, I was brought up to speed with the state of the project. The website was 
                functionally complete; it’s primary features (Cities, People, Time) had been built and its StoryMaps had already been created 
                for the Stories section. However, NYU Press (the book’s publisher) suggested making some improvements to the website’s UX, 
                specifically:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul class='case-study-bullets'>
                <li><span class='embolden'>Scrolling mechanism</span> - The original website used fullPage.js in order to provide an ‘on-rails’ 
                    experience for exploring the content, evocative of the feeling of reading a book. However, this also produced a choppy scrolling 
                    effect that made exploration slow and difficult. We decided that the new website needed to have a smoother scrolling 
                    effect so that users could explore more freely.
                </li>
                <li><span class='embolden'>Stories page</span> - The aforementioned full-page scrolling effect made browsing the various 
                    StoryMaps available on the Stories page difficult. Because each StoryMap thumbnail occupied the entire viewport, users 
                    could only view one at a time. Therefore, if a user wanted to access the 10th StoryMap on the page, they had to scroll 
                    down 9 times. This required significant effort from users to browse through all of the StoryMaps available.
                </li>
                <li><span class='embolden'>Home page</span> - The existing home page contained a nice block of introductory text that 
                    effectively conveyed the purpose of the website (section 1).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <div class='flex-screenshots-container'>
                <div class='flex-screenshot'><img src='rich-brew-old-homepage-section1.jpg'><div class='screenshot-subtitle'>Home page section 1</div></div>
                <div class='flex-screenshot'><img src='rich-brew-old-homepage-section2.jpg'><div class='screenshot-subtitle'>Home page section 2</div></div>
                <div class='flex-screenshot'><img src='rich-brew-old-homepage-section3.jpg'><div class='screenshot-subtitle'>Home page section 3</div></div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class='case-study-bullets'>However, the remaining sections of the home page didn’t provide effective forward paths for users 
                to begin exploring the website’s tools and content. For example, the next section (section 2) used the entire viewport to provide 
                instructions for using the website.
                <br><br>
                It wasn’t until the third section of the home page (requiring users to scroll down twice) that users were finally presented 
                with forward paths to the website’s primary features. Additionally, the links in this section didn’t directly correspond to 
                the labels in the navigation bar (e.g. ‘guided story’ vs. ‘Stories’). 
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul class='case-study-bullets'>
            <li><span class='embolden'>Navigation bar</span>- The existing navigation bar was functional but lacked clear organization and 
                recognizable labels (e.g. ‘Start here’ linked to the home page). While Cities, People, and Time all function as complementary 
                tools, utilizing the same database, Stories is a markedly different feature, containing StoryMaps content that isn’t shared by 
                any of the website’s other features.
            <br><br>
            <div class='screenshot'><img src='rich-brew-old-navigation-bar.png' id ='navbar'><div class='screenshot-subtitle'>Navigation bar</div>
            </ul>
            <br><br><br>
            <p class='case-study-paragraph'>As the team’s new UX Designer, it was my job to resolve these issues. In order to gain a better 
                understanding of the design decisions that resulted in the current website, I reached out to the website’s original designer. 
                The original website was designed and built entirely by one team member who’s experience lied primarily in software 
                development. They were forthcoming about what they believed to be the design’s shortcomings and provided valuable insight 
                into the team’s process for creating the website. I continued to communicate with them throughout the redesign process.
                <br><br>
                By synthesizing information about the issues that we identified, I formed two conclusions:
            </p>
            <ul class='case-study-bullets'>
                <li>There was an opportunity to improve the <span class='embolden'>website’s structure</span> so that it better reflects the 
                    relation between the various sections.</li>
                <li>As discussed earlier, the <span class='embolden'>full-page scrolling mechanism</span> negatively impacted the website’s 
                    overall UX; however, it also contributed to the specific issues that were identified on the Stories and Home pages.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p class='case-study-paragraph'>These conclusions helped clarify the problems that our team was attempting to solve and enabled us 
                to begin acting on them.
            <br><br>
            In order to improve the website’s structure, I created a sitemap that included a clear distinction between the Cities, People, and 
            Time pages and the Stories page. This was accomplished by introducing an Explore landing page that grouped the Cities, People, and 
            Time pages together. My intention was to simplify the website’s navigation while introducing a structure that better reflects the 
            relation between its different sections. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class='screenshot'><img src='rich-brew-sitemap.png'><div class='screenshot-subtitle'>Sitemap</div></div>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <p class='case-study-paragraph'><span class='case-study-subsubheading'>Wireframes</span>
            <br>
            After creating a new sitemap, I proceeded to produce a set of low-fidelity wireframes for both the new and existing pages of the 
            website. Due to its importance, I began with the home page.
            <br><br>
            <span class='embolden'>Home page</span>
            <br>
            The home page needed to concisely convey the purpose and context of the website while providing clear forward paths to its primary features.</p>
            <br><br>
            <div class='screenshot' id='wireframe-homepage'><img src='rich-brew-homepage-wireframe.png'></div>
            <br><br>
            <p class='case-study-paragraph'>For the home page’s wireframe, I attempted to do the following:
            </p>
            <ul class='case-study-bullets'>
                <li><span class='embolden'>Simplify the navigation bar</span> by consolidating the Cities, People, and Time navigation links into a single dropdown menu. I 
                    also changed Start here to Home since the latter is more familiar to users.</li>
                <li><span class='embolden'>Place the primary features' forward paths in their own distinct sections</span> and provide context 
                    regarding their respective purposes. This would allow users to distinguish between the various features and better 
                    understand what they each offer.</li>
                <li><span class='embolden'>Communicate how to use the website through the home page’s design</span> rather than explicit text 
                    instructions. This would also allow us to remove the original full-page set of instructions featured on the page.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <p class='case-study-paragraph'>
            <span class='embolden'>Footer</span>
            <br>
            I worked with Prof. Pinsker to determine what information the footer needed 
            to display. He decided that it should include acknowledgements for the 
            project’s funding sources, and I suggested that we include contact information 
            as well as a sitemap.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <div class='screenshot' id='wireframe-footer'><img src='rich-brew-footer-wireframe.png'></div>
            <br><br><br>
            <p class='case-study-paragraph'>
            <span class='embolden'>Explore</span>
            <br>
            The Explore page needed to act as a simple landing page that would lead 
            users to the Cities, People, and Time features. Because this was a new 
            page, there wasn’t any existing content that needed to be included.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <div class='screenshot' id='wireframe-explore'><img src='rich-brew-explore-wireframe.png'></div>
            <br><br>
            <p class='case-study-paragraph'>In designing the Explore page, I tried to emphasize simplicity. It only needed to 
                provide forward paths and additional context for the Cities, People, and Time features. Because all three features 
                are complementary and equally important, none of them are given prominence over the others.
            <br><br>
            <span class='embolden'>Stories</span>
            <br>
            The new Stories page needed to facilitate users browsing through the variety of StoryMaps available. Since the original 
            website’s use of fullPage.js made this difficult, my first step in redesigning the page was to reduce the size of the StoryMaps’s 
            thumbnails considerably so that several of them could fit within the viewport.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <div class='screenshot' id='wireframe-stories'><img src='rich-brew-stories-wireframe.png'></div>
            <br><br>
            <p class='case-study-paragraph'>With the new design, StoryMap titles are displayed in a semi-transparent black bar at the bottom of 
                the thumbnails. When users move their cursor over a thumbnail, its black bar extends over the remainder of the thumbnail and 
                displays a brief description of the StoryMap. In designing this effect, my intention was to utilize progressive disclosure to 
                provide users with just enough information to decide which StoryMap they would like to explore.
            <br><br><br>
            <span class='case-study-subsubheading'>Prototyping</span>
            <br>
            After creating the low-fidelity wireframes, I created a HTML/CSS prototype that reflected the changes I was proposing. Over the 
            course of a week, I quickly created a semi-responsive HTML/CSS prototype using the static site generator Jekyll. I hosted the 
            website on GitHub Pages and shared it with the rest of the team, asking for feedback. As a team, we reviewed the prototype and 
            identified possible opportunities for improvement. After our review, we decided that we were ready to move forward and begin 
            fleshing out the wireframes.
            <br><br><br>
            <span class='case-study-subsubheading'>High-Fidelity Mockups</span>
            <br>
            Around this time, we brought on another team member with a background in graphic design. Due to my lack of experience with color, 
            typography, and branding, I felt much more comfortable having a visual designer assist us in bringing the low-fidelity wireframes 
            to high-fidelity mockups. I worked with them to tweak some aspects of the UI while they worked with Prof. Pinsker to determine 
            how the website’s aesthetic should reflect that of the book.
            <br><br>
            The visual designer and I were able to collaborate on creating the high-fidelity mockups through Figma’s real-time collaboration 
            features. While they handled decisions regarding visual details, I provided guidance on how the website should function and feel. 
            Once we produced something that we both liked, we presented the results to the rest of the team.
            <br><br>
            <span class='embolden'>Home page</span>
            <br><br>
            </p>
            <div class='screenshot' id='mockup-homepage'><img src='rich-brew-homepage-mockup.png'></div>
            <br><br>
            <p class='case-study-bullets'><i>- Header & Navigation</i>
            <br>
            The visual designer I worked with had the idea of using one large image for the page’s background and only having it appear in 
            the page’s header and footer. The effect this created was visually appealing and communicated to users that they reached the bottom 
            (or top) of the page. The visual designer suggested centering the website title and navigation to keep a more familiar, conventional look.
            <br><br>
            <i>- About</i>
            <br>
            By reflecting on the original set of wireframes I created, I decided that we could combine the About section’s text and the introductory 
            block of text. Since the two sections served a similar purpose (to inform the user about the project and provide a forward path to the 
            About page), combining these sections eliminated redundant content and simplified the flow of the home page.
            <br><br>
            <i>- Explore</i>
            <br>
            The visual designer on our team was able to enhance the presentation of the Explore section by adjusting the layout and including large, 
            engaging imagery to represent the different Explore features.
            <br><br>
            <i>- Stories</i>
            <br>
            During our review of the prototype, our team decided that the featured stories displayed in the Stories section would ultimately work 
            better in a 1x4 row than a 2x2 square. We felt that this would better communicate to users that there are more stories available, 
            since the row could conceivably extend indefinitely (as the screen width increases) whereas the square is self-contained.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <p class='case-study-paragraph'><span class='embolden'>Explore</span>
            <br>
            The Explore page mockup that we presented to the team was nearly an exact reflection of the page’s original wireframe. Although 
            the visual designer and I felt that this was an effective design for the page, some other members of the team felt that the page 
            should place a greater emphasis on the images. The visual designer and I reflected on this feedback and modified the page’s design 
            so that it better emphasized the images.
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class='flex-screenshots-container'>
                <div class='flex-screenshot' id='mockup-explore'><img src='rich-brew-explore-mockup1.png'><div class='screenshot-subtitle'>Explore page version 1</div></div>
                <div class='flex-screenshot' id='mockup-explore'><img src='rich-brew-explore-mockup2.jpg'><div class='screenshot-subtitle'>Explore page version 2</div></div>

            <p class='case-study-paragraph'><span class='embolden'>Stories</span>
            <br>
            The high-fidelity mockup of the Stories page remained largely the same as the low-fidelity prototype. However, one key change is 
            the removal of the black, hover-activated summary windows for each of the stories. During our review of the prototype, Prof. 
            Pinsker said that he liked the idea but did not have the time required to create summaries for each of the stories.
