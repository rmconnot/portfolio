            <h2 class="case-study-header">Background</h2>
            <p class='case-study-paragraph'>In Fall 2019 I participated in the <a target=blank href='https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/professional-and-community-engagement/design-clinic' class='body-link'>University of Michigan Design Clinic program</a>. Design Clinic pairs 
                groups of students with local clients who can benefit from the program’s focus on problem solving through design thinking.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class='case-study-paragraph'>My group was paired with <a target=blank href='https://votersnotpoliticians.com/' class='body-link'>Voters Not Politicians (VNP)</a>, a pro-democracy organization that was instrumental in passing <a target=blank href='https://ballotpedia.org/Michigan_Proposal_2,_Independent_Redistricting_Commission_Initiative_(2018)' class='body-link'>Proposal 2 
                (2018)</a>. The proposal effectively ended gerrymandering in Michigan by establishing an Independent Redistricting Commission. 
                Importantly, one of its key components is the requirement for the commission to consider citizens’ input throughout the 
                redistricting process. The first Independent Redistricting Commission will be formed in Summer 2020.
            </p>
            <br>

                <h3 class='case-study-subheading'>The Problem</h3>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>In other states that have passed similar legislation (California and Arizona), the 
                    redistricting commissions did not have formal processes in place for citizens to provide input. This led to the 
                    commissions receiving input in a variety of formats (emails, physical mail, speeches at public hearings). Because the 
                    input varied so greatly in format, it also varied in usefulness to the commmissions' redistricting efforts.
                </p> 
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>VNP is seeking to preemptively provide a more effective means for the commission to collect citizens’ input, so that 
                    Michiganders could ultimately have a greater, more meaningful impact on the state’s redistricting process.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>VNP approached Design Clinic to help them explore different ways in which citizens could share their input, and ultimately 
                    recommend a system to them that would facilitate this sharing.
                </p>

                <h2 class='case-study-header'>Scoping</h2>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Our team quickly scheduled an introductory meeting with our primary stakeholder, a senior 
                    member of VNP. During our first meeting we began scoping the project, a process that would continue over the following 
                    weeks. During this process, our team was attempting to accomplish several things:
                </p>
                    <br>

                <ul class='case-study-bullets'>
                    <li>Set achievable expectations for the project</li>
                    <li>Determine what the actual problem we needed to solve was</li>
                    <li>Ensure that our final recommendations (whatever they may be) would be actionable by the client</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Due to the sheer magnitude of the problem we were trying to solve, the scoping phase lasted 
                    nearly a month and continued to be re-addressed throughout the course of our time working on the project. Ultimately, we 
                    were able to produce a concise problem statement that allowed us to begin solving the problem:
                </p>
                <br>

                <p class='case-study-paragraph' id='case-study-quote'><i>"Michigan’s Independent Redistricting Commission needs an effective system for collecting citizens’ 
                    input about their communities of interest in order to draw district lines that preserve the integrity of these communities."</i>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>After settling on an actionable problem statement, we worked with our client to determine the course of the project as well 
                    as what deliverables our would ultimately provide. This process involved evaluating how effective various forms of 
                    deliverables would be in helping us address our problem statement.
                </p>
                <h2 class='case-study-header'>Research</h2>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>The next phase in the course of our project was research. Because of the considerable domain 
                    knowledge this project required, we knew that user research alone would not be sufficient. Therefore we divided the 
                    research duties into the following categories:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul class='case-study-bullets'>
                    <li><span class='embolden'>Background research</span> regarding the redistricting processes of states who have passed similar 
                        legislation (California and Arizona)... essentially ”what worked and what didn’t?”</li>
                    <li><span class='embolden'>Product research</span> evaluating the variety of digital redistricting tools currently 
                        available</li>
                    <li><span class='embolden'>User research</span> in order to learn more about who the system’s potential users are and how they might 
                        be affected by its introduction</li>
                    <li><span class='embolden'>Usability research</span> that helped us understand what users’ optimal method of interacting 
                        with a redistricting system might look like. This research also illuminated a myriad of issues with existing solutions 
                        as well as our early design prototypes.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>I chose to take on responsibilities for the product research and usability research while the 
                    other members of my team assumed responsibility for the other research duties.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class='case-study-subheading'>Product Research</h3>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>My product research involved first identifying which tools are currently available that would 
                    suit VNP’s purposes. I reached out to several redistricting experts to learn which tools they recommended using. I also 
                    searched for tools on my own through simple Google searches and reading relevant articles.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>After identifying a number of tools, I created a set of criteria I could use in order to 
                    evaluate their suitability for VNP. The three main criteria were: 
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul class='case-study-bullets'>
                    <li><span class='embolden'>Cost -</span> our primary stakeholder stressed this as a major concern from our first meeting</li>
                    <li><span class='embolden'>Degree of customization required -</span> an out-of-the-box solution would be ideal; 
                        unfortunately, it doesn’t yet exist</li>
                    <li><span class='embolden'>Method of map-drawing -</span> some tools allow users to draw free-form polygons while others only allow 
                        users to highlight pre-drawn precincts</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Based on these criteria, I suggested that VNP consider using the APIs for either <a target=blank href='https://districtr.org/' class='body-link'>Districtr</a>, 
                    <a target=blank href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation' class='body-link'>Google Maps</a>, or <a target=blank href='https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/' class='body-link'>ArcGIS</a>. (During our final meeting with our client, they confirmed that they will be using Google Maps.)
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class='case-study-subheading'>Usability Research</h3>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Once I had settled on three different applications which we would be recommending to VNP, 
                    I collaborated with another team member to conduct guerilla usability testing. Because Districtr offered a 
                    fundamentally different method of indicating location (highlighting precincts) than Google Maps or ArcGIS 
                    (drawing free-form polygons), I wanted to better understand how users interact with each of these methods. 
                    Therefore, I resolved to use Districtr and the Google Maps (specifically the My Maps feature) for the usability 
                    tests, due to their contrasting methods of location indication.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Our usability tests consisted of approaching strangers in public areas such as libraries, 
                    campus buildings, and coffee shops and asking if they would be willing to spend ~10 minutes using two mapping 
                    applications If they agreed, then we briefly introduced them to the first application on a laptop and simply asked 
                    them to “please indicate the location of your neighborhood, using the tools available to you.” We provided minimal 
                    guidance and made note of issues users encountered. After they had succeeded or given up, we introduced them to the 
                    second application and asked them to do the same thing. After the user was finished with the second application, we 
                    debriefed them, asking open ended questions about their experience with both applications (what they liked, what they 
                    didn’t like, which tool they preferred, why) and thanked them for their time.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>These usability tests provided us with a number of key insights:</p>
                <br>
                <ul class='case-study-bullets'>
                    <li>Users prefer to enter a location into a search bar instead of manually zooming in to find it. However, many users did 
                        not use the search bars provided by the two applications we tested. Initially, we were confused why this was 
                        occurring; however, we eventually discovered that many of our users simply didn’t notice the search bars when they 
                        began using the applications. We decided that our team’s design needed to feature a prominent search bar that users 
                        could immediately identify.</li>
                    <li>Users struggled to locate each application’s respective tools for actually “marking” or indicating a geographic area. 
                        These tools tended to be given little prominence in the applications’ UIs, often being placed in a small toolbar near 
                        the corners of the window. Again, we decided that our team’s design needed to lend greater prominence to this UI element.</li>
                    <li>Most users felt that the precincts laid out in Districtr mapped onto their actual neighborhoods with fairly high 
                        accuracy. When asked about their precinct’s accuracy, several users said, “it’s pretty close to how I would have 
                        drawn it”.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>With the product and usability research complete, I documented our findings in a preliminary 
                    report and shared them with the team during our weekly team meeting. As other team members completed their research 
                    duties, they shared their findings as well. As a team, we prepared to move on to the design phase of the project.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>One key decision that was made by our group during this period was that the system we were 
                    designing would take the form of a website, or online portal, that would enable users to “draw” and submit a map 
                    indicating the locations of their communities of interest as well as descriptions of the respective communities. In 
                    making this decision, we were attempting to balance ease-of-use for citizens with the usefulness of the information to 
                    the Independent Redistricting Commission. In other words, the system that we were designing needed to be simple and easy 
                    for citizens to use, but it also needed to provide valuable information for the commission for their redistricting 
                    purposes. We felt that an online portal struck a good balance between these two interests.
                </p>
                <h2 class='case-study-header'>Design</h2>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Earlier, while determining the course of the project, our team agreed to provide VNP with 
                    the following deliverables:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul class='case-study-bullets'>
                    <li><span class='embolden'>Task flow</span></li>
                    <li><span class='embolden'>Low-fidelity wireframes</span></li>
                    <li><span class='embolden'>Medium-fidelity prototype</span></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Around this time, we decided that we could collaborate on these design deliverables as a 
                    team. Since everyone worked on different aspects of the research, we wanted to ensure that nobody’s perspective was 
                    left out from the actual design.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class='case-study-subheading'>Task flow</h3>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>With the task flow, we tried to make it as simple as possible, only requiring the steps that 
                    were truly necessary. The logic behind several of the steps will become clear through the design.
                </p>

                <br><br><br>
                <h3 class='case-study-subheading'>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>

                <br>
                    <img src='vnp_whiteboard.png' class='flex-screenshot' id='full-photo'>
                    <p class='case-study-paragraph' id='flex-paragraph'>We began the process of creating our wireframes with a group whiteboarding session. During 
                        this session, we listed the elements that our design needed to include and began sketching rough wireframes that 
                        communicated how we intended for citizens to use the website.
                    </p>

                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Next, one of our group members began translating these sketches into a Balsamiq design file. 
                    I collaborated with her to flesh out the wireframes and make adjustments.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>During this time, I proposed making the map “drawing” step optional for users who would rather 
                    not submit a map. This suggestion was informed by both the usability research and user research that our team had 
                    conducted, both of which indicated that many users are not fully comfortable or willing to use a mapping application in 
                    order to provide input about their communities. With this proposed change, users would only be required to submit a 
                    written description of their communities; the map would be optional.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>The team agreed with this proposal and we created an alternate version of the original 
                    wireframe. We then presented both versions to the client in order to receive feedback regarding the usefulness of a 
                    map-less submission to the Independent Redistricting Commission. Our client agreed that the map-drawing step could and 
                    probably should be optional, so we pursued the alternate version.

                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Through our research about Michigan, we learned two things:</p>
                <ul class='case-study-bullets'>
                    <li>Michigan is a relatively diverse state, with a sizeable populations of those for whom Spanish and Arabic are their 
                        primary languages.</li>
                    <li>Most Michigan citizens are not familiar with Proposal 2, the redistricting process, or even gerrymandering in general.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>In our design of the homepage, we addressed these realities by including relevant language 
                    options as well as introductory text about the redistricting process and why the user’s input is important.

                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Unsuprisingly, our user research found that because of the ambiguity of the term “community of 
                    interest”, many people struggle to understand what it is that we’re asking for. Therefore, we included an introductory 
                    section that defines what is meant by “community of interest”.

                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Our usability research found that many users encountered difficulty when trying to “draw” 
                    their community on a map. Therefore, we included an instructional page that demonstrates how to use the mapping tools 
                    provided. This also allows users to get a taste of the mapping process and decide if it’s a step they would rather skip.

                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Through our user research, we found that many people, especially those in historically 
                    marginalized communities, were hesitant to provide personal information in a political context. Therefore, we tried to 
                    make sure that we only required them to provide the minimum amount of personal information necessary for the commission 
                    to verify that the submission came from an actual Michigan resident.

                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>After we finished creating our low-fidelity wireframes, we presented them to our client and 
                    shared them with the mentor that had been assigned to our team at the beginning of the semester. We received a lot of 
                    great feedback and proceeded to create the medium-fidelity prototype.

                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>With our team’s medium-fidelity prototype, we set out to simplify the submission process 
                    even further while refining the UI elements we had introduced in the low-fidelity wireframes.

                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Through further usability testing with our low-fidelity wireframes, we found that the 
                    submission process took slightly more than ten minutes to complete, on average; we reflected in the new homepage. 
                    One piece of important feedback that we received from our team’s mentor was that “there are really only 3 steps involved, 
                    some of the steps just have an extra page”. This led us to present the submission process as a ‘3-step process’ that 
                    users could more easily understand. We were also provided with some copy that we could use to provide context.

                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>The purpose of the community of interest page is to help users understand what constitutes a Community of 
                    Interest. Through our user testing, we found that people struggled to understand the term ‘Communities of Interest’. 
                    Therefore, we decided to include a page where users can get a better understanding of the term.

                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>We decided to keep the description page as simple as possible. We based the four questions we asked on an 
                    explanatory handout developed by UC Berkeley’s Law Redistricting Group for California’s Redistricting Commission.

                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>In order to further simplify the submission process, we removed the tutorial page from the 
                    list of steps in the low-fidelity wireframes. Instead, we provide a link to an external webpage that presents the video 
                    tutorial in case users need help understanding how to draw a map.

                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>One of the public hearings that we attended had a member of California’s redistricting 
                    commission present to discuss their process. One important thing she mentioned was that after a citizen submitted their 
                    input, the commission would often contact citizens to clarify certain aspects of their submission. Therefore, we found 
                    it important to require contact information from users so that the Commission can contact them with any questions. For 
                    now, we used physical address and email address to authenticate that the person submitting the form is a real human. In 
                    the design we placed a question mark next to physical address, so that VNP can include information as to why a physical 
                    address was being asked in the first place. Users may want to know the exact purpose of providing this information.

                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Underneath the contact information page we give users the opportunity to review their 
                    submission before pressing “Submit”. We believed that allowing users to receive a copy of their submission via email 
                    would be beneficial.

                <h2 class='case-study-header'>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>We presented our final design along with our findings and other deliverables to our client 
                    in the format of a 43-page report as well as a formal in-person presentation. They were pleased with the results and 
                    thanked us for our work on the project. Shortly after our presentation, they informed us that they have found a software 
                    engineering firm to continue developing the website. VNP shared our final report with the firm and they have reached 
                    out to several members of our group with questions about the project. Looking forward, the firm will continue developing 
                    the website so that it is ready for the Independent Redistricting Commission in Summer 2020, when the commission will be 
                    formed. I plan to provide input through the website when it’s ready!

                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>Looking back, there were several areas of the project that I wish we could have done 
                    differently. Most importantly, given the time constraints of the project (1 semester), I wish we could have spent less 
                    time scoping the project and more time conducting user research and usability testing. Our team’s relative inexperience 
                    with client work and the inherent complexity of the project led to the scoping phase lasting slightly longer than was 
                    absolutely necessary. If we had more time, we could have conducted more usability tests and user interviews.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class='case-study-paragraph'>I was very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work on such an important and impactful 
                    project. Additionally, I couldn’t have asked for a better group to work with. I was lucky to have several talented and 
                    hardworking team members that made the project a valuable learning experience.
